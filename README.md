# ARQ1 – Computer Architecture and Organization 1

This repository contains the practical activities I developed and presented during the **ARQ1 (Computer Architecture and Organization 1)** course.

## 🛠️ About the Course

In this course, we explored the fundamentals of computer architecture and organization, including low-level programming and processor behavior. The activities were implemented using both **32-bit** and **64-bit** architectures.

## 📁 Repository Contents

- Assembly programming exercises  
- Simulations and architecture-related experiments  
- Practice assignments involving registers, memory, and instruction execution

## 🎯 Objective

To document and organize the practices completed during the course, serving as a reference for further studies in computer systems and low-level programming.
